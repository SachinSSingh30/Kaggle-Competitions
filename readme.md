#Digit Recognition#

*Using the famous MNIST data for Digit Recognition*
CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) is used to make the neural network learn the classification of digits from 0-9 

**Competition Description**

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto ‚Äúhello world‚Äù dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We‚Äôve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.

**Practice Skills**

-Computer vision fundamentals including simple neural networks
-Classification methods such as SVM and K-nearest neighbors

#NLP Tweets Classification#

*üëãWelcome to one of our Getting Started machine learning competitions.*

This particular challenge is perfect for data scientists looking to get started with Natural Language Processing. The competition dataset is not too big, and even if you don‚Äôt have much personal computing power, you can do all of the work in our free, no-setup, Jupyter Notebooks environment called Kaggle Notebooks.
Competition Description

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they‚Äôre observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it‚Äôs not always clear whether a person‚Äôs words are actually announcing a disaster. Take this example: *'On plus side LOOK AT THE SKY LAST NIGHT WAS ABLAZE'*

The author explicitly uses the word ‚ÄúABLAZE‚Äù but means it metaphorically. This is clear to a human right away, especially with the visual aid. But it‚Äôs less clear to a machine.

In this competition, you‚Äôre challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one‚Äôs aren‚Äôt. You‚Äôll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. If this is your first time working on an NLP problem, we've created a quick tutorial to get you up and running.

#House Price Prediction#

**Competition Description**

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

**Practice Skills**

    -Creative feature engineering 
    -Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
